# Feed Store  <img align="left" src="./x48.png" alt="Feed Store Logo">
This project is an online backend to store and provide RSS feeds.
Think of it as a cache between a feed provide and a feed reader.

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/sgrottel/feed-store)](./LICENSE)

It is not an aggregator to (actively) collect information from other online sources and create feeds out of it.
An active part needs to use the write-end api to push the feed information in.
It is suited to cache content generated by on-event code, and then provided to readers at any time.
