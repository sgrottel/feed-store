# ðŸ—ƒ Feed Store
This project is an online backend to store and provide RSS feeds.
Think of it as a cache between a feed provide and a feed reader.

It is not an aggregator to (actively) collect information from other online sources and create feeds out of it.
An active part needs to use the write-end api to push the feed information in.
It is suited to cache content generated by on-event code, and then provided to readers at any time.

This project consists of:

* [Open API Specification](spec/feed-story.yaml)
  * [Generated API Documentation](doc/README.md)
* ...
